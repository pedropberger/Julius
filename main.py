"""Welcome to Julius!

This is a simple code created to extract data from all City Transparency Portals of the state of Esp√≠rito Santo, Brazil.
Every portal has your own API, but they have similar patterns (depends on the company that create them).
We catalog them in 4 diferent patterns to extract data in a efficient way.

You have 2 ways to execute this code. Using threads or not.
If you choose use threading you can select how API methods (data clusters) u want extract.
A full extract consumes 4gb of you hard disk."""
