# Julius
Bot that capture data from Transparency Portals of all cityes of the state of Espírito Santo, Brazil. After that, deploy know typologies to find corruption indicators (people with two public jobs, companys selling overpriced stuff, etc)

# About the project

This project comes from an initiative of the servers of the Innovation Unit of the Public Prosecutor's Office of the State of Espírito Santo, with the aim of capturing data to expand the possibilities of investigating administrative misconduct, evaluating the data made available by the portals (in accordance with Law 12.527/2011) and applying typologies that provide evidence of corruption practices. The name "Julius" is a reference and tribute to the character Julius from the series "Everybody Hates Cris", because the first typology tested was the verification of people with two jobs (but in this case, undue accumulation of public positions), and also because of the second name of the first collaborator of the project, the dev Fabrício Julio Correia de Almeida.

Because it is a learning tool and because it uses exclusively public government data, we decided to restart the project as an open initiative, restarting its development independently from any institution and making the codes available here on Github. The idea is to start from what already works, test, improve, create and refine the codes and functions with Data Engineering techniques, Artificial Intelligence and good development practices. That's also why the Readme and all documentation (even code comments) are in English as the default language, learning English is good for everyone.
